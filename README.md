### **Clustering Algorithms Explored**
1. **K-Means**
2. **K-Medoids**
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**
4. **Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)**
5. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**

---

### **Skills Demonstrated**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and cleaning large datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights from raw data and preparing it for clustering.
- **Clustering Evaluation**: Using metrics such as **silhouette scores** to assess the performance of different algorithms.
- **Outlier Handling**: Identifying and mitigating the impact of outliers on clustering results.
- **Principal Component Analysis**: Condensing data down so it can be visualized as either 2D or 3D data
- **T-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding**:

### **Projects Overview**
#### 1. **Auto MPG**
The first project in this repository is a project from MIT's **Data Science and Machine Learning Program**. The project utilized T-SNE and PCA in order to reduce dimensionality of the data and extract insights.

#### 2. **Market Segmentation with K-Medoids (MIT Capstone)**
The second project in this repository is my capstone project from MIT's **Data Science and Machine Learning Program**. After evaluating multiple clustering algorithms, I selected **K-Medoids** as the most appropriate for the dataset due to its:
- High **silhouette score**, indicating compact and well-separated clusters.
- Robustness against **outliers**, which was crucial for this dataset.

The project includes:
- Raw data
- Preprocessed and analyzed data
- Code for clustering and evaluation
- Final presentation delivered on December 13, 2023

**Details of this project can be found in the** [Market_Segmentation_With_K-Medoids folder](https://github.com/Garlid/Unsupervised-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Market_Segmentation_With_K-Medoids).
